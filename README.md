# PROJECT IDEA :
This project is a **Quiz Maker and Quiz Game** using Python and MySQL. It allows users to create quizzes and participate in them. The application features two main functionalities:
## 1. Quiz Creation:
Users can create quizzes by specifying the quiz name and the number of questions.For each question, users can input the question itself, along with four possible options (A, B, C, and D), and the correct answer.The quiz data is stored in a MySQL database, with each quiz having its own table containing the questions and answer options.
## 2. Quiz Participation:
Participants can choose a quiz from the list of available quizzes.The application presents the questions one by one, and the participant must select the correct option within a time limit of one minute per question.At the end of the quiz, the participant's score is calculated based on correct answers, and feedback is provided.The participant's name, the quiz they participated in, and their score are recorded in a separate participants table in the database.
